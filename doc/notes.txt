To do:
- Add unit tests for PVTCoord and CoordSys.convertFrom variants that use PVTCoord.
- Add unit tests for untested PVT functionality, such as polarFromXY, xyFromPolar and unary minus
- Unit test NoneCoordSys and MountCoordSys
- Unit test makeCoordSys
- Add more methods that work with PVTCoord, once I figure out what is required.
  Candidates include:
  - PVTCoord.angularSeparation (arguments are PVTCoords; result is PVT)
  - PVTCoord.angleTo (argument is PVTCoord; result is PVT)
  Perhaps wait until I have a need for these?
- Figure out how to make a PVT & argument a return value in SWIG
- Consider having PVT be included by mathUtils, so that the scalar and PVT flavors of functions can be defined in the same file.
