Issues:

- Diurnal aberration magnitude is different between Site and TCSpk:
   site.diurAbMag=-4.24453e-07 ///< magnitude of diurnal aberration vector:
            /// speed of rotation of observatory / speed of light (radians/au)
   tsite.diurab 1.3062e-06 # Diurnal aberration amplitude (radians)
  I think this is OK, but double check to make sure. Once I figure it out, document it somewhere
  (perhaps where it is set by setPoleWander; it's subtle enough that it might be confusing in site.h?),
  since I'm pretty sure I have wondered this before.

To do:
- Add more methods that work with PVTCoord, if needed, such as:
  - PVTCoord.angularSeparation (arguments are PVTCoords; result is PVT)
  - PVTCoord.angleTo (argument is PVTCoord; result is PVT)

Unit tests to add:
- PVTCoord and CoordSys.convertFrom variants that use PVTCoord.
- Untested PVT functionality, such as setFromPair (once I can call that from python)

SWIG questions:
- Learn to call PVT.setFromPair from Python
