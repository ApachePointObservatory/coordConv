Issues:

- diurnal aberration magnitude is different between Site and TCSpk:
   site.diurAbMag=-4.24453e-07 ///< magnitude of diurnal aberration vector:
            /// speed of rotation of observatory / speed of light (radians/au)
   tsite.diurab 1.3062e-06 # Diurnal aberration amplitude (radians)
  why are they different, and does it matter? Check the code that computes these values and applies them.


To do:
- Add more methods that work with PVTCoord, once I figure out what is required.
  Candidates include:
  - PVTCoord.angularSeparation (arguments are PVTCoords; result is PVT)
  - PVTCoord.angleTo (argument is PVTCoord; result is PVT)
  Perhaps wait until I have a need for these?
- Consider having PVT be included by mathUtils, so that the scalar and PVT flavors of functions can be defined in the same file.

Unit tests to add:
- site.setPoleWander
- PVTCoord and CoordSys.convertFrom variants that use PVTCoord.
- Untested PVT functionality, such as unary minus and setFromPair (once I can call that from python)
- Unit test NoneCoordSys and MountCoordSys
- Unit test makeCoordSys

SWIG questions:
- Learn to call PVT.setFromPair from Python
- Figure out how to make a PVT & argument a return value in SWIG
  (e.g. PVTCoord.getSphPVT should probably return two values, not fill two values)
