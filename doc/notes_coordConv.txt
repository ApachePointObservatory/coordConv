Issues:

- Diurnal aberration magnitude is different between Site and TCSpk:
   site.diurAbMag=-4.24453e-07 ///< magnitude of diurnal aberration vector:
            /// speed of rotation of observatory / speed of light (radians/au)
   tsite.diurab 1.3062e-06 # Diurnal aberration amplitude (radians)
  I think this is OK, but double check to make sure. Once I figure it out, document it somewhere
  (perhaps where it is set by setPoleWander; it's subtle enough that it might be confusing in site.h?),
  since I'm pretty sure I have wondered this before.

SWIG questions:
- Learn to call PVT.setFromPair from Python and then unit test it.
  One solution is to implement std::array support in coordConv (moving it there from pytcc).
  Then N-dimensional arrays would be trivial and safe C++ and Python. But it would result in
  a potentially awkward mix of ndarray, Eigen and std::array. One strange way to solve that
  would be to stop passing Eigen around at all and pass 3x3 rotation matrices as 9-element arrays;
  as long as they are computed and used by coordConv that's not too bad, but it's ugly if
  those rotation matrices will be constructed or used by any other code.
