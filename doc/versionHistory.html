<h1><a href="index.html">coordConv</a>: Version History</h1>

<h3>Documentation update 2015-01-13</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added a software license (BSD-3 in doc/license.txt) and changed readMe.txt to ReadMe.md.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.3 2015-06-04</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed a vestigial semicolon from a python unit test.
    <li>Added a software license.
    <li>Changed the ReadMe to a markdown file.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.2 2014-10-15</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Made compatible with more modern C++ compilers, while retaining backwards compatibility, by using boost::tr1 for array.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.1 2014-09-24</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Modernized the exception catching syntax.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.0 2014-09-02</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added CoordSys.taiFromDate methods.
    <li>Added besslianEpochFromTAI and taiFromBesselianEpoch functions.
    <li>AppGeoCoordSys changed maxAge from 1 second to 0.05 seconds. This will make lunar tracking errors negligible even at a high update rate.
    <li>Added functions appTopoFromAppGeo, appGeoFromAppTopo, obsFromAppTopo and appTopoFromObs, and removed similar methods from AppTopoCoordSys and ObsCoordSys.
    <li>Enhanced the documentation, including a working example and listing most classes and functions on the main source code documentation page, with working links.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.9.4 2014-09-01</h3>

<ul>
    <li>AppGeoCoordSys changed default maxAge (of the cache) from 300 seconds to 1 second. 300 seconds was too long for more accurate lunar tracking.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.9.3 2014-09-01</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Changed CoordSys.setCurrTAI to CoordSys.setCurrDate for self-consistency.
    <li>Changed CoordSys operator== to test isCurrent and updated the unit test accordingly.
    <li>Changed default date of ICRSCoordSys and GalCoordSys from 2000 to 0 (current date).
    <li>Added a unit test for AppGeoCoordSys's cache.
    <li>Added a unit test for coordinate system default constructors.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.9.2 2014-08-31</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Bug fix: AppGeoCoordSys date was not being reliably updated by setCurrTAI.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.9.1 2014-08-29</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added documentation files doc/index.html, doc/versionHistory.html and readMe.txt and updated doc/main.dox accordingly.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.9 2014-08-27</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Updated timeCoordConv to also time conversion of PVTCoord.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.8 2014-08-27</h3>

<p>This is a major refactoring, primarily to fix a bug in computing velocity when converting PVTCoords from apparent geocentric coordinates to apparent topocentric coordinates. Significant changes include:
<ul>
    <li>Changed PVTCoord to an object that models linear spatial velocity instead of velocity along a great circle. This is a much simpler model and capable of representing the change in distance with time. However, now PVTCoord is only intended to support computation of instantaneous velocity, not to represent the long-term track of a moving object.
    <li>Changed CoordSys to support "current" coordinates, which are represented by date=0. This included adding two new methods: isCurrent() and setCurrTAI(tai), the latter of which allows you to set the current TAI date while computing coordinates without visibly changing anything about the CoordSys (it is a const method; the data that is updated is considered an internal cache). This allows setting the current date without copying data, and allows use of cached apparent geocentric data without excessive recomputation, thus significantly speeding up coordinate conversions for PVTCoords.
    <li>AppGeoCoordSys now automatically avoids recomputing the cache for very nearby times, thus eliminating the need for freezeCache argument of setDate.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.7 2014-08-25</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Minor doc and variable name cleanups.
    <li>Some improvements to tests/testCoordConvAgainstTCC.py.
    <li>Bug fix: examples/timeCoordConv.py failed while timing the computation of apparent geocentric cached data due to unreasonable dates for large numbers of iterations.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.6 2014-08-19</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Enabled generation of Doxygen documentation (by adding missing SConscript and doxygen.config.in files to the doc dir).
    <li>Update the source documentation to make Doxygen happy.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.5 2014-08-13</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Bug fix: parallax was mis-computed, due to using longitude instead of latitude.
    <li>Enhanced tests/testCoordConvAgainstTCC.py (and in the process discovered and fixed a bug in the old TCC).
    <li>Updated documentation to make Doxygen happy.
    <li>Added a separate version.py file.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.3 2014-07-13</h3>

<p>First version with version history.
